These variable names are not valid

char      char is a reserved word
6_95      variable names cannot start with digits
A$        $ is not a valid character

These variable names are valid, but are not advisable to use nonetheless

Int     int (starting with lowercase) is a reserved word, using "Int" is confusing

Calloc  calloc() (starting with lowercase) is the C library function that allocates
        the requested memory and returns a pointer to it. Using "Calloc"is confusing as well
